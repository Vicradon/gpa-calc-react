# Issues
1. Adding new levels isn't working as expected. The level that keeps getting added is 200 level
2. It only works when one adds a new level and closes the modal
3. A possible solution would be to automatically change the user to the new level and close the modal


```javascript
if (!(
  a('side-menu') 
  // a('user-details') ||
  // a('hor-line') ||
  // a('user-icon') ||
  // a('username') ||
  // a('side-menu-links')
)) 
```
